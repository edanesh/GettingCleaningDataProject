The features/variables selected for this database come from the original list of features acquired from the Samsung Galaxy S accelerometer and gyroscope data. For a complete list of features and the way they have been drived, take a look at features.txt and features_info.txt in:

Here, only the Mean and Standard Deviation (Std) variables for each measurement are used. The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers (Subjects). Each Subject performed six Activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing the smartphone on the waist. 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
Note: Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
